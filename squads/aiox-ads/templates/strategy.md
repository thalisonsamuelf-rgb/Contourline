## Active Directives

### PREFER

Directives that agents SHOULD follow when making decisions. Use these as defaults unless data contradicts.

| # | Directive | Rationale | Added |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | {Example: PREFER video over static for cold traffic} | {Higher engagement in this niche} | {date} |

### AVOID

Patterns, strategies, or actions that have been tested and failed, or carry unacceptable risk.

| # | Directive | Rationale | Added |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | {Example: AVOID broad targeting on accounts < 90 days} | {Triggers Meta moderation AI} | {date} |

### CONSTRAINT

Hard limits that agents MUST NOT violate. Override PREFER if conflict exists.

| # | Constraint | Source | Added |
