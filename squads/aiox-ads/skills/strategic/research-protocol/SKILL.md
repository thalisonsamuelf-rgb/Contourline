## Overview

Complete 5-phase research protocol executed BEFORE any campaign. Collects intelligence about the business, competitors, differentiators and benchmarks to inform all campaign decisions. This is the mandatory ENTRY POINT for the ads flow -- no campaign should start without a complete research-brief.

**Activation Command:** `*research {business_slug}`
**Announce:** "Activating Research Protocol -- 5 phases of intelligence before any campaign."
**Agent:** @ad-midas
**Tier:** Auto (read-only, no API writes)

## 5-Phase Protocol

### Phase 1 -- Load Strategic Context

```yaml
name: 'Load STRATEGY.md + business-profile.yaml'
type: 'context-loading'
tools: ['Read']

steps:
  - action: 'Load STRATEGY.md'
    path: 'workspace/businesses/{slug}/ads/STRATEGY.md'
    on_missing: 'Create skeleton from template squads/aiox-ads/templates/strategy.md'
    note: 'Initialize with default CONSTRAINTS from safety-rules.yaml'

  - action: 'Load business-profile.yaml'
    path: 'workspace/businesses/{slug}/ads/briefing/business-profile.yaml'
    on_missing: 'Create skeleton from template squads/aiox-ads/templates/business-profile.yaml'
    note: 'Mark status: incomplete, log warning, continue with available data'

  - action: 'Load product-card.yaml (if exists)'
    path: 'workspace/businesses/{slug}/ads/briefing/product-card.yaml'
    on_missing: 'Skip -- will be populated from Phase 2 crawl'

  - action: 'Load icp-profile.yaml (if exists)'
    path: 'workspace/businesses/{slug}/ads/briefing/icp-profile.yaml'
    on_missing: 'Skip -- will be inferred from Phase 2 crawl'

## Output Format

```yaml

  business: 'example-business'
  execution_date: '2026-03-18'
  agent: '@ad-midas'
  status: 'complete'

  phases_completed:

    business_profile: 'workspace/businesses/example-business/ads/briefing/business-profile.yaml'

  key_findings:
    opportunities:
      - 'Competitors not using video ads -- opportunity for video-first approach'
      - 'No competitor addresses {specific pain point}'
      - 'Market gap in {audience segment}'
    risks:
      - 'No Pixel/CAPI detected on brand site'
      - 'Competitor {name} dominates Ad Library with 50+ active ads'
      - 'Pricing higher than market average without clear differentiation'

  recommended_next:
    skill: 'funnel-selection'
    command: '*select-funnel'
    reason: 'Research complete, select funnel type before campaign-briefing'
```

---

## Safety and Constraints

```yaml
tier: 'Auto'
rationale: 'Research protocol is entirely read-only -- no API writes, no budget changes, no campaign modifications'

constraints:
  - 'WebFetch: max 10 pages total per execution (5 brand + 5 competitor)'
  - 'WebSearch: max 5 queries per competitor identification'
  - 'MCP get_insights: read-only, no write operations'
  - 'Never publish or share competitive data externally'
  - 'Minimum 2 competitors required for valid analysis (warn if below, do not halt)'
  - 'If brand site is unreachable, log error and proceed with available data'

error_handling:
  site_unreachable: 'Log warning, skip Phase 2 brand crawl, note gap in research-brief'
  no_competitors_found: 'Use industry template competitors as fallback reference'
  mcp_unavailable: 'Fall back to Path B (industry benchmarks) in Phase 5'
  ad_library_blocked: 'Note limitation in research-brief, proceed with WebSearch data only'
```

---

## Integration

### Triggered By

- Start of new campaign (mandatory first action)
- `setup-business-profile` -- after collecting business data
- User command -- `*research {business_slug}`

### Dispatches To

- `funnel-selection` -- to select funnel type post-research
- `competitive-intel` -- can be called standalone for deep-dive on a specific competitor
- `unit-economics` -- when research identifies pricing/margin data
- `campaign-briefing` -- research-brief feeds Phase 2 of briefing

### Agent Assignment

- **Primary:** @ad-midas (concierge model)
- **Execution:** @ad-midas orchestrates all 5 phases
- **Input from:** @performance-analyst (if historical data exists)

## Usage Examples

```
*research aiox
  --> Executes full 5-phase protocol for business slug "aiox"

*research bilhon --skip-phase5
  --> Executes phases 1-4 only (new business, no ad history)

*research empresa-exemplo --competitors "Competitor A, Competitor B"
  --> Skips competitor identification, goes straight to analysis
```
