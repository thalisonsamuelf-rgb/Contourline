# Audit Landing Page Task

## Purpose

Comprehensive landing page audit combining Alex Hormozi's Value Equation, MECLABS Conversion Sequence Heuristic, StoryBrand Framework, and CXL best practices. Delivers actionable scorecard with prioritized fixes and A/B test recommendations.

## When to Use

- Landing page converting below industry benchmarks
- High traffic but low conversions
- Before scaling ad spend
- After offer or messaging changes
- A/B test planning and prioritization
- Launching new campaign or funnel
- Competitive analysis of competitor pages

## Framework Foundation

### MECLABS Conversion Sequence Heuristic

```
C = 4M + 3V + 2(i-f) - 2a

Where:
M = Motivation of user (×4 weight)
V = Value proposition clarity (×3 weight)
i = Incentive to act now (×2 weight)
f = Friction in the process (-×2 weight)
a = Anxiety about converting (-×2 weight)
```

### Alex Hormozi Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort Required)

Maximize: Dream Outcome, Likelihood
Minimize: Time Delay, Effort
```

### StoryBrand BrandScript

```
Character → Problem → Guide → Plan → Call to Action → Failure → Success
```

## Phase 13: Copywriter Style Application

### 13.1 Style Guide Integration

```yaml
copywriter_styles:
  claude_hopkins:
    principle: "Specificity over generality"
    application: "Replace vague claims with specific numbers"
    example:
      before: "Grow your business fast"
      after: "Grow your revenue 47% in 90 days"

  david_ogilvy:
    principle: "Headlines do 80% of the work"
    application: "Spend 80% of optimization time on headlines"
    example:
      before: "Welcome to Our Service"
      after: "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock"

  gary_halbert:
    principle: "Enter the conversation in their head"
    application: "Use exact customer language from research"
    example:
      before: "Optimize your conversion rate"
      after: "Finally stop watching visitors leave without buying"

  eugene_schwartz:
    principle: "Match copy sophistication to awareness level"
    application: "Adjust page structure based on traffic temperature"
    stages:
      unaware: "Lead with problem, not solution"
      problem_aware: "Agitate problem, introduce solution"
      solution_aware: "Differentiate your solution"
      product_aware: "Overcome objections, prove value"
      most_aware: "Make offer, reduce friction"
```

### 13.2 Copy Rewrite Templates

```yaml
headline_rewrites:
  generic_to_specific:
    pattern: "[Generic benefit]" → "[Specific number] + [Specific outcome] + [Timeframe]"
    example:
      before: "Grow Your Business"
      after: "Add $47K Monthly Revenue in 90 Days"

  feature_to_benefit:
    pattern: "[Feature]" → "[Outcome the feature creates]"
    example:
      before: "AI-Powered Analytics"
      after: "Know Exactly Which Ads to Scale (and Which to Kill)"

  we_to_you:
    pattern: "We [do X]" → "You [get Y]"
    example:
      before: "We provide expert marketing services"
      after: "You get marketing that actually brings in customers"

cta_rewrites:
  generic_to_action:
    pattern: "[Generic]" → "[Action verb] + [My/Your] + [Benefit]"
    example:
      before: "Submit"
      after: "Get My Free Audit"

  first_person:
    pattern: "Get Your [X]" → "Get My [X]"
    lift: "+25-90%"
