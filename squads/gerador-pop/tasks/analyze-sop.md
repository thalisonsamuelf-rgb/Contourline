## Metadata
```yaml
id: analyze-sop
name: "Analyze & Grade SOP"
category: analysis
agent: pop-analista
elicit: false
autonomous: true
description: "Perform multi-dimensional analysis and scoring of an existing SOP across 10 quality dimensions. Produces a comprehensive report with weighted scores, gap detection, and prioritized remediation recommendations."
```

## Purpose

Evaluate an existing SOP against 10 quality dimensions derived from ISO 9001, FDA/GMP, Six Sigma, and Gawande's principles. This analysis produces a quantitative score (A through F), identifies specific gaps, and provides actionable remediation recommendations. The analysis is autonomous and does not require user input beyond the SOP file.

This is the foundational analysis task. For benchmarking against specific standards, use `benchmark-sop`. For full compliance audit, use `audit-sop`.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] SOP file exists and is readable
- [ ] SOP is in Markdown, YAML, or JSON format
- [ ] Scoring rubric (`sop-scoring-rubric.yaml`) accessible

## Inputs

```yaml
inputs:
  sop_file:

```

## Workflow / Steps

### 1. Ingest SOP

```
ACTION: Read and parse the SOP file

DETECT:
  - File format (Markdown, YAML, JSON)
  - Presence of YAML front matter
  - Section structure and hierarchy
  - Total word count and step count

STORE: sop_content = {
  raw_text, format, sections[], steps[],
  word_count, step_count, has_front_matter
}
```

### 2. Structural Analysis

```
ACTION: Check all expected sections against FDA/GMP template

MAP each found section to expected 11 sections:
  1. Header Block
  2. Purpose
  3. Scope
  4. Definitions
  5. Responsibilities (RACI)
  6. Materials & Equipment
  7. Procedure
  8. Error Handling
  9. Quality Control
  10. References
  11. Revision History

OUTPUT: structural_report = {
  sections_found: <count>/11,
  missing_sections: [<names>],
  extra_sections: [<names>],
  section_quality: { <section>: <brief assessment> }
}
```

### 3. Content Analysis

```
ACTION: Analyze content quality signals

MEASURES:
  a) Readability
     - Calculate Flesch-Kincaid grade level (approximate)
     - Count average sentence length
     - Identify passive voice instances
     - Count undefined jargon/acronyms

  b) Action Verb Analysis
     - Check each procedure step for leading action verb
     - List steps without action verbs
     - Identify compound steps (multiple actions)

  c) Completeness Check
     - Are inputs defined?
     - Are outputs defined?
     - Are roles assigned?
     - Are tools specified?
     - Are time estimates present?
     - Are edge cases covered?

OUTPUT: content_report = {
  readability_grade, passive_voice_pct,
  action_verb_pct, compound_step_count,
  completeness_score, missing_elements[]
}
```

### 4. Dimensional Scoring

```
ACTION: Score across all 10 dimensions using the rubric above

FOR EACH dimension:
  1. Evaluate each signal (1-10 scale)
  2. Calculate dimension average
  3. Apply dimension weight
  4. Record evidence for each score

CALCULATE:
  total_weighted_score = SUM(dimension_score * weight) for all 10 dimensions
  grade = map to A/B/C/D/F scale

OUTPUT: scores = {
  dimensions: {
    clarity: { score: X, weighted: X, evidence: "..." },
    completeness: { score: X, weighted: X, evidence: "..." },
    ...
  },
  total_score: <0-100>,
  grade: "<A|B|C|D|F>",
  grade_label: "<description>"
}
```

### 5. Gap Detection

```
ACTION: Identify specific gaps, ambiguities, and risks

CATEGORIES:
  - MISSING: Required elements that are absent
  - AMBIGUOUS: Statements that could be interpreted multiple ways
  - INCOMPLETE: Sections present but insufficient
  - INCONSISTENT: Contradictions between sections
  - DEAD_END: Process paths with no defined outcome
  - RISK: Safety, compliance, or quality risks from gaps

FORMAT per gap:
  - id: "GAP-{N}"
    category: "<category>"
    location: "<section/step reference>"
    description: "<what is wrong>"
    impact: "high|medium|low"
    dimension_affected: "<dimension name>"
```

### 6. Remediation Recommendations

```
ACTION: Generate prioritized improvement recommendations

FOR EACH gap:
  - Specific fix description
  - Example of correct implementation
  - Effort estimate (quick-fix / moderate / major)
  - Priority (P1: must fix / P2: should fix / P3: nice to have)

PRIORITIZATION:
  P1: Safety, compliance, or executability gaps (score < 5 on critical dimensions)
  P2: Completeness, measurability, error handling gaps (score 5-7)
  P3: Visual design, accessibility, AI-readiness improvements (score 5-7)

OUTPUT: remediation_plan = [
  { priority, gap_id, fix_description, example, effort }
]
```

### 7. Generate Report

```
ACTION: Compile full analysis report

STRUCTURE:
  # SOP Analysis Report: {SOP Name}

  ## Executive Summary
  - Overall Grade: {grade} ({score}/100)
  - Key Strengths (top 3 dimensions)
  - Critical Gaps (top 3 issues)

  ## Scorecard
  | Dimension | Weight | Score | Weighted | Grade |
  |-----------|--------|-------|----------|-------|
  | Clarity | 10% | X/10 | X.X | A-F |
  | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
  | **TOTAL** | **100%** | | **X.X** | **{grade}** |

  ## Dimensional Analysis
  ### 1. Clarity (Score: X/10)
  - Evidence: ...
  - Gaps: ...
  - Recommendation: ...
  [repeat for all 10 dimensions]

  ## Gap Inventory
  | ID | Category | Location | Impact | Fix Priority |
  [all gaps]

  ## Remediation Plan
  ### Priority 1 (Must Fix)
  ...
  ### Priority 2 (Should Fix)
  ...
  ### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
  ...
