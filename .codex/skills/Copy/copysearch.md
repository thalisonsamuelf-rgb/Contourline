## Core Principle

> **"The discipline of knowledge over the anarchy of ignorance."**
> — David Ogilvy

---

## Purpose

Transform Ogilvy's research methodology into an executable framework for AI agents conducting market research, competitive intelligence, and creative brief development—while maintaining evidence standards and preventing hallucination/cherry-picking.

**The essential question:** *"How do I know this is true, and how might I be fooling myself?"*

## EVIDENCE HIERARCHY (Memorize This Order)

| TIER | TYPE | VALIDATION | USE IN COPY |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| 🥇 **GOLD** | Direct response results, sales data, verified technical documentation | Sales/response tracking, source verification | Headlines, primary claims |
| 🥈 **SILVER** | Expert interviews, systematic competitive analysis, diagnostic metrics | Cross-reference | Supporting claims |
| 🥉 **BRONZE** | Consumer stated preferences, focus groups | Behavioral cross-check | Hypothesis only, use qualifiers |
| ❌ **REJECT** | Creative awards, unverified claims, intuition | N/A | NEVER use |

> **"We have been unable to establish any correlation whatever between awards and sales."**
> — David Ogilvy, *Ogilvy on Advertising*

---

## PHASE 0: MISSION BRIEFING
### *Before any research begins*

**Objective:** Define scope, establish validation criteria, prevent scope creep.

> **"I notice increasing reluctance on the part of marketing executives to use judgment; they are coming to rely too much on research, and they use it as a drunkard uses a lamp post—for support, rather than for illumination."**
> — David Ogilvy

### Checklist 0.1 — Research Definition

```
elicit: true
question: "What specific business decision must this research inform?"
format: text
```

- [ ] What is the specific business decision this research must inform?
- [ ] What would "sufficient evidence" look like to make this decision?
- [ ] What claims will require GOLD-tier evidence vs. SILVER-tier?
- [ ] What is explicitly OUT of scope?
- [ ] Who is the human accountable for research accuracy?
- [ ] What is the deadline and depth trade-off?

### Checklist 0.2 — Anti-Hallucination Setup

- [ ] Confidence threshold defined (default: 70% for auto-accept, below requires human review)
- [ ] Citation requirement activated (no claim without source)
- [ ] Provenance tracking enabled (source → page/section → date accessed)
- [ ] Cross-validation protocol selected (2+ independent sources for key claims)
- [ ] "I don't know" response authorized for insufficient evidence

### Output Artifact: Research Charter

```
RESEARCH CHARTER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Gold-tier requirements: [claims needing behavioral/verified evidence]
Out of scope: [explicit exclusions]
Accountable human: [name]
Deadline: [date] | Depth level: [rapid/standard/deep]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT/TECHNICAL RESEARCH (Layer 1)
### *"Become the best-informed person on the subject"*

**Objective:** Extract verifiable facts, specifications, and non-obvious product truths.

> **"For Rolls-Royce, I spent three weeks reading about the car. By the time I finished, I knew more about it than 90% of the people who buy Rolls-Royces."**
> — David Ogilvy, *Confessions of an Advertising Man*

### Step 1.1 — Document Collection

```
elicit: true
question: "What technical documentation do you have available about the product?"
options:
  - Product manuals/specifications
  - Patents or proprietary documentation
  - Engineering reports
  - Onboarding transcripts
  - Demo videos
  - API/code documentation (for tech)
  - Certifications/lab reports
  - Independent test results
  - Other (specify)
```

**Source Priority (in order):**
1. Official product specifications, manuals, technical sheets
2. Patent filings and regulatory submissions
3. Independent lab tests and certifications
4. Engineering reviews and technical journalism
5. Manufacturer claims (verify before use)

### Step 1.2 — Fact Extraction

**For each material, extract using this template:**

```
FACT: [specific claim]
SOURCE: [document name]
LOCATION: [page/section/paragraph]
DATE: [publication date]
CONFIDENCE: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
VERIFICATION: [how to verify independently]
```

**Extraction Rules:**
1. Seek SPECIFIC NUMBERS (not "many" but "147")
2. Seek UNIQUE PROCESSES (how it's made differently)
3. Seek TESTS PERFORMED (proof of quality)
4. Seek MEMORABLE DETAILS (French walnut picnic tables)

> **"When research reported that the average shopper thought Sears Roebuck made a profit of 37 per cent, we headlined an advertisement 'Sears makes a profit of 5 per cent.' This specific number was more persuasive than saying Sears' profit was 'less than you might suppose.'"**
> — David Ogilvy, *Ogilvy on Advertising*

### Step 1.3 — Creator Interviews

```
elicit: true
question: "Can you schedule an interview with the product creator/engineer?"
options:
  - Yes, I can schedule
  - I have transcripts from previous calls
  - I have access to internal documents
  - No direct access
```

**Questions for interview:**
1. "What does nobody know about how this is made?"
2. "What technical detail makes you most proud?"
3. "What do competitors NOT do that you do?"
4. "If you had to convince a skeptic, what single fact would you use?"
5. "What was the most rigorous test the product passed?"

### Step 1.4 — Anchor Fact Identification

**Ogilvy Standard:** *"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."*

**Anchor Fact Criteria (all must be true):**
- [ ] **Specific** — Numbers, measurements, concrete details
- [ ] **Surprising** — Not obvious, challenges assumptions
- [ ] **Differentiating** — Competitors cannot credibly claim this
- [ ] **Verifiable** — Source can be cited, claim can be tested
- [ ] **Relevant** — Connects to consumer benefit

### Checklist 1.1 — Product Research Quality Gate

- [ ] Read ALL available technical documentation (not summaries)
- [ ] Interviewed or have transcripts from creators
- [ ] Found at least 3 facts no competitor uses
- [ ] Each fact has complete provenance (source + location + date)
- [ ] Numerical claims verified against original source
- [ ] Superlatives flagged for verification ("best," "first," "only")
- [ ] Identified anchor fact candidate passing all 5 criteria

## PHASE 2: CONSUMER/LANGUAGE RESEARCH (Layer 2)
### *"Use their language, the language in which they think"*

**Objective:** Understand how real consumers talk about the problem, product category, and their desires—in their own words.

> **"If you're trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language, the language they use every day, the language in which they think."**
> — David Ogilvy, *Confessions of an Advertising Man*

> **"The trouble with market research is that people don't think how they feel, they don't say what they think, and they don't do what they say."**
> — David Ogilvy

### Step 2.1 — Voice of Customer Mining

```
elicit: true
question: "What Voice of Customer sources do you have available?"

## PHASE 3: COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (Layer 3)
### *"Know thy enemy better than thyself"*

**Objective:** Systematically map competitor positioning, claims, and gaps.

> **"Find out all you possibly can about the merits, faults and sales arguments of competitors, and then keep quiet about them. Profound knowledge of other cookers will help you put your positive case more convincingly."**
> — David Ogilvy, *The Theory and Practice of Selling the Aga Cooker*

### Step 3.1 — Competitor Identification

```
elicit: true
question: "Who are the main competitors?"
format: list
minimum: 3
maximum: 10
```

**Define competitive set:**

## PHASE 4: EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS (Layer 4)
### *"The second most important decision: what should you promise?"*

**Objective:** Convert research into positioning, proposition, and proof stack.

> **"We have learned that the effect of your advertising on sales depends more on this decision than on any other: How should you position your product? The results of your campaign depend less on how we write your advertising than on how your product is positioned."**
> — David Ogilvy, "How to Create Advertising That Sells" (1972)

### Step 4.1 — Positioning Decision

**Positioning Criteria (all must be true):**
- [ ] **Differentiated** — Competitors cannot credibly claim this
- [ ] **Relevant** — Consumers actually care about this
- [ ] **Credible** — We can prove this
- [ ] **Sustainable** — Defensible over time
- [ ] **Ownable** — We can own this in consumer minds

### Step 4.2 — Proposition Development

> **"A promise is not a claim, or a theme, or a slogan. It is a benefit for the consumer."**
> — David Ogilvy, *Ogilvy on Advertising*

**Proposition Template:**
```
FOR [target audience]
WHO [have this problem/desire]
[PRODUCT] IS THE [category]
THAT [key benefit/promise]
BECAUSE [reason why/proof]
```

### Step 4.3 — Proof Stack Assembly

**Proof Hierarchy (use in this order):**
1. Third-party verification (tests, certifications)
2. Specific numbers and measurements
3. Ingredient/component specifics
4. Process/method details
5. Expert endorsements
6. Customer results (verified)
7. Testimonials (lowest, but better than no proof)

### Step 4.4 — Big Idea Test

> **"Did it make me gasp when I first saw it? Do I wish I had thought of it myself? Is it unique? Does it fit the strategy to perfection? Could it be used for 30 years?"**
> — David Ogilvy, *Ogilvy on Advertising*

- [ ] Did it make me gasp when I first saw it?
- [ ] Do I wish I had thought of it myself?
- [ ] Is it unique?
- [ ] Does it fit the strategy to perfection?
- [ ] Could it be used for 30 years?

### Checklist 4.1 — Synthesis Quality Gate

## PHASE 5: CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Layer 5 - Part 1)
### *"Now, and only now, start writing"*

**Objective:** Generate creative executions grounded in research.

> **"Give me the freedom of a tight brief."**
> — David Ogilvy

### Step 5.1 — Headline Generation (25+)

> **"On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."**
> — David Ogilvy, *Ogilvy on Advertising*

**Headline Types to Generate:**
1. Direct benefit statement
2. News/announcement format
3. How-to promise
4. Question format
5. Testimonial/quote format
6. Specific number/statistic
7. Challenge/provocative
8. Story/curiosity opener

**Words that work (Ogilvy):**
- Free, New, How to, Suddenly, Now, Announcing, Introducing
- Improvement, Amazing, Sensational, Remarkable, Revolutionary
- Quick, Easy, Wanted, Challenge, Compare, Bargain, Hurry

**Headline rules:**
- [ ] Contains benefit
- [ ] Contains brand (when relevant)
- [ ] 6-12 words
- [ ] Works alone (doesn't need body copy)
- [ ] Flags the right audience

### Step 5.2 — Copy Structure (Ogilvy Long-Copy Model)

> **"The more you tell, the more you sell."**
> — David Ogilvy

```
1. HEADLINE: Captures attention with benefit or curiosity
2. SUBHEAD: Expands/qualifies the headline
3. LEAD: Hooks with problem recognition or promise
4. ANCHOR FACT: The single most compelling proof
5. PROOF STACK: Additional evidence building credibility
6. OBJECTION HANDLING: Address key barriers
7. OFFER: What exactly they get
8. CALL TO ACTION: Specific next step
9. RISK REVERSAL: Guarantee or safety net
```

### Checklist 5.1 — Creative Quality Gate

## PHASE 6: VALIDATION & ACCOUNTABILITY
### *"We sell, or else"*

**Objective:** Ensure research translates to results; maintain feedback loop.

> **"Direct response was my first love and later it became my secret weapon."**
> — David Ogilvy

> **"You people who know direct response have it in your power to rescue the advertising business from its manifold lunacies."**
> — David Ogilvy

### Step 6.1 — Skin in the Game Gates

**GATE 1 — SOURCE**
> "Where does this information come from?"
- [ ] Each critical insight has traceable source (URL, document, quote)
- [ ] Insights without source: DISCARD or FIND source

**GATE 2 — VERIFICATION**
> "Can I verify this independently?"
- [ ] Critical insights cross-checked with 2+ sources
- [ ] Unverified insights marked as such

**GATE 3 — REPRESENTATIVENESS**
> "Does this represent the whole or is it cherry-picking?"
- [ ] Quantitative analysis exists (not just isolated examples)
- [ ] Sample is sufficient (not cherry-picking)

**GATE 4 — HUMAN**
> "Has an expert validated this?"
- [ ] Critical claims reviewed by human specialist
- [ ] If not: DO NOT use in final copy

### Step 6.2 — Red Flags (Stop if any marked)

- [ ] ❌ Insight seems too good to be true
- [ ] ❌ No traceable source
- [ ] ❌ AI "discovered" something nobody else has seen
- [ ] ❌ Numerical data without clear origin
- [ ] ❌ Generalizations without quantitative data
- [ ] ❌ Contradicts what the client said
- [ ] ❌ Cannot be verified independently

**If ANY red flag marked:** STOP and investigate before proceeding.

### Step 6.3 — Pre-Launch Verification

- [ ] All claims verified against original sources
- [ ] Legal/compliance review completed (if required)
- [ ] Anchor fact passes "prove it to a skeptic" test
- [ ] No hallucinated statistics or quotes
- [ ] Competitive claims are defensible
- [ ] Tracking and measurement configured
- [ ] Success metrics defined with baseline
- [ ] Human accountability assigned

## PHASE 7: TESTING & MEASUREMENT (Layer 5 - Part 2)
### *"Never stop testing"*

**Objective:** Connect research recommendations to business outcomes.

> **"The most important word in the vocabulary of advertising is TEST. If you pretest your product with consumers, and pretest your advertising, you will do well in the marketplace."**
> — David Ogilvy

### Step 7.1 — Metric Hierarchy (Ogilvy-Aligned)

| Priority | Metric | Tier | What it measures |
|----------|--------|------|------------------|
| 1 | Revenue/Sales | GOLD | Did it sell? |
| 2 | Conversions/Signups | GOLD | Did they act? |
| 3 | Cost per acquisition | GOLD | Was it efficient? |
| 4 | Engagement metrics | SILVER | Did they interact? |
| 5 | Awareness/Recall | BRONZE | Did they remember? |

### Step 7.2 — Test Plan

```yaml
test_1:
  variable: "[headline A]" vs "[headline B]"
  hypothesis: "[why A might beat B]"
  primary_metric: "[conversions]"
  duration: "[X days or Y conversions]"
  tie_breaker: "[secondary criterion]"
```

### Step 7.3 — Research Retrospective

After campaign performance data is available:

- [ ] Did winning creative align with research recommendations?
- [ ] Were any research predictions wrong? Why?
- [ ] Which proof points performed best in copy?
- [ ] Which consumer language resonated most?
- [ ] What research should be repeated/updated?
- [ ] What would Ogilvy change if reviewing this?
